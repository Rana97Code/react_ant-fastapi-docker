*************kubernetes architecture*************

Kubernetes Components:

Kubernetes based on Cluster.
 Official details:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/

Inside Cluster there have two main modules

	=> Control Plane or Master
	=> Node or Workers

   Control Plane:
	Inside Control Plane there is 4 more modules
		=>API Server (All API's get and post from there)
		=>ETCD (Stored all details infromation about Node and POD)
		=>Control Manager (Control all request and responce from API Server) 
		=>Scheduler (Execute All command from Control Manager)
  
   Node:
	Inside Node there also 4 modules
		=>Kubelet (Kubelate has all details about this Node's all POD and it makes sure that containers inside POD is running or not.)
		=>Kube-proxy (Stored all network information)
		=>Container Engine (Stored Engine like Docker, Rocket)
		=>POD (Pod stored all container)



Installation Kubernetes:
	
	For Windows PC we can use Minikube 
	 Download and install in local pc : https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/


Minikube start and all:
	After install need to open terminal and run command >minikube start
	minikube status check> minikube status
	For Dashboard > minikube dashboard
	Then it will open a dashboard plane: http://127.0.0.1:51608/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/http:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/ 
	minikube push> minikube push
	minikube unpush> minikube unpause
	minikube stop > minikube stop
	minikube addons list> minikube addons list


	
Deploy applications:
	By Deployment we are creade a POD

	>kubectl create deployment hello-minikube --image=python/fastSMS

Make this deployment pod as a service:
	>kubectl expose deployment hello-minikube --type=NodePort --name=hello-minikube-service --port=80
	
	View this service> kubectl get services hello-minikube

	View minikube deployements > kubectl get deployments
	View Pod > kubectl get pods
	View Cluster events> kubectl get events
	View Kubectl configuration> kubectl config view



For run in web browser:
	>minikube service hello-minikube

For change port:
	>kubectl port-forward service/hello-minikube 7080:8080
	and port service port:http://localhost:7080/.
